		<h3>ORIGIN:</h3>
		<img class="rfloat smallerimg leftpadding" src="images/killers4.jpg" alt="The Killers">
	<p>In 2001, Brandon Flowers was fired by his first band, a Las Vegas synthpop trio known as Blush Response. After attending an Oasis concert at the Hard Rock Hotel during The Tour of Brotherly Love, Flowers realized his calling was to be in a rock band and began searching for like-minded musicians. He eventually came across an ad posted in a Las Vegas newspaper by Dave Keuning, a 25-year-old guitarist who had moved to Vegas from Iowa a year earlier. When the pair met they bonded over similar musical influences and immediately began writing songs together in Keuning's apartment. In November 2001, they headed to Kill The Messenger Studio in Henderson, Nevada, along with recently recruited drummer Matt Norcross to begin recording a demo; they recorded two tracks: "Mr. Brightside", which was the first song Flowers and Keuning wrote together, and "Desperate". A month later they recorded two more, "Under the Gun" and "Replaceable", with Keuning's roommate Dell Neal on bass.</p></section>
