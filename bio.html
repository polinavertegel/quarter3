	<h2 class="normalfont h2size h2underline">Bio of Polina Vertegel by Polina Vertegel</h2>
	<section class="section border"><h3 class="bofont bigfont redfont">I have one dog</h3><br>
	<p><img src="images/dogpic1.JPG" alt="My dog" class="imgmargin"><img src="images/dogpic2.jpg" alt="My dog" class="rotate"></p>
	<p>My dog is an English Bulldog. Her name is Sonia and she is 2 years old. She is really sweet and cuddly and she likes to go outside. We got her in the summer of 2017. She loves to play with soccer balls.</p></section>
	<h3 class="bofont bigfont">My family is Russian </h3><br>
	<p><img src="images/fampic1.JPG" alt="Family" class="rotate2 biggerimg"><img src="images/fampic2.JPG" alt="Family" class="rotate2 biggerimg imgmargin"></p>
	<p>We speak Russian at home. I am first generation born in America in my family. The rest of my family members were born in Russia and either stayed there or, like my parents and my grandparents on my mom's side, immigrated to the US. All of my extended family lives in Russia, so I don't see them often.</p>
	<section class="section border"><h3 class="bofont bigfont redfont">My favorite YouTuber is Jenna Marbles</h3><br>
	<p><img src="images/jnj1.JPG" alt="Jenna Marbles and Julien Solomita" class="rotate"><img src="images/jnj2.JPG" alt="Jenna Marbles and Julien Solomita" class="rotate imgmargin"></p>
	<p>I've been watching Jenna's videos since I was in third grade, since 2011. I finally met her in 2016 along with her boyfriend, Julien. I think they are the sweetest and funniest people on YouTube. It's not easy to find genuine people like Jenna and Julien online anymore. Over the past 7 years, I watched them develop their content into something they love and I am so glad I've stayed with them for so long.</p></section>
	<h3 class="bofont bigfont">I love listening to music</h3><br>
	<p><img src="images/music1.jpg" alt="concert" class="rotate bigimg"><img src="images/music2.JPG" alt="piano" class="rotate bigimg imgmargin"></p>
	<p>Listening to music is one of my favorite things to do. My music taste is very flexible, as in I like a lot of different types of music, so I will literally listen to anything. It doesn't matter what genre it's in. I've also played piano for 11 years, so I think that also increased my knowledge in music and helped me appreciate music more.</p></div>
